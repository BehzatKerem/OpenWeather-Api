# Weather App

The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to get weather information for a specific city. Users can enter the city name in the input field, and the app will fetch and display the current weather data, including temperature, weather description, and the minimum and maximum temperatures for the day.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure of the web page is created using HTML.

- CSS: The app's style and layout are defined using CSS.

- JavaScript: JavaScript is used to handle user interactions, fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, and display the retrieved data on the webpage.

- OpenWeatherMap API: The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Enter the name of the city you want to get weather information for in the input field and press the "Enter" key.

4. The app will fetch and display the current weather data for the entered city.

## API Key (Important)

Please note that the app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. Make sure to replace the `key` variable in `script.js` with your own API key obtained from OpenWeatherMap. Visit [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/) to sign up and get your API key.

## Styling

The app's appearance and layout are defined in the `style.css` file. The app uses the 'Montserrat' font from Google Fonts and has a dark-themed background color.
